# Murder_Mystery_SQL_Project
In this project, I used SQL to solve a murder

Welcome to my SQL Murder Mystery project! This project demonstrates my SQL skills through an engaging data exploration challenge where I solved a fictional murder mystery by querying a database and uncovering key clues.

Prompt: A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

This SQL Murder Mystery project is an interactive, data-driven challenge designed to test and showcase SQL querying abilities, logical thinking, and data analysis skills. The goal was to use SQL commands to sift through complex data, identify suspects, find evidence, and solve the case.
In this project, I utilized my knowledge of SQL to:
1. Navigate, Identify and query tables in the database that contained potential leads.
2. Use filtering conditions to narrow down suspects and evidence.
3. Apply logical operations, join complex data tables and extract necessary attributes to reveal hidden relationships and piece together the mystery.

Conclusion:
The SQL Murder Mystery project was a great opportunity to apply my SQL knowledge in a fun, yet practical scenario. It showcases my proficiency in working with relational databases and my analytical approach to solving data-centric problems.
